Any relevant concepts or ideas related specifically to SKILLS should go here


In the style of Cyberpunk 2077, all skills can be unlocked and active at once. Each skill tree (Combat, Signs, Alchemy and General) has its own pool of skill points and those points are acquired by performing actions related to those trees e.g. performing attacks/dodges contribute to the Combat tree while casting signs contribute to the Signs tree

The skill slots though will still have a purpose in the form of mutagens. Mutagens can be places in each skill slot and can contribute buffs to Geralt. The normal mutagen slots are for craftable Archmutagens, if the equipped mutagens match the family that the archmutagen is from when equipped it will buff those mutagens while also providing its own strong buffs

Mutations will serve as a means to improve the synergy between your sword, alchemy and sign skills meaning you can effectively combine them to create incredibly powerful moves
