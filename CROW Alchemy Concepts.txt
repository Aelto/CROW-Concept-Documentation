Any relevant concepts or ideas related specifically to ALCHEMY should go here

Every herb and monster part you pick up can be converted into a specific alchemical essence. 
These essences will then be used to craft all of your alchemical items


There is now only one tier of alchemical item rather than 3 as usual. 
What you can change though in the alchemy menu is the amount of an item you craft per brew which will depend on the alchemical base you use. 
Higher quality bases will award more item yield but will also cost more essence to do so as well. 
With LEGO though donâ€™t expect to find high quality bases easily
