# CROW-Concept-Documentation
This repository serves as a collective idea centre for all ideas, concepts and suggestions for the CROW overhaul project

The CROW project for those unfamilliar is a proposed overhaul of The Witcher 3 that aims to provide new more in-depth systems for the game while retaining the game's more simplistic style

Inspiration is being drawn from classic RPG games like Guild Wars 2 as well as various other action games and even some other overhaul mods for Witcher 3 like Enhanced Edition

Anyone can contribute to this concept through making a push request to a relevant file in the repository. If you have ideas or thoughts about this concept then do share them

If you want to discuss the project more directly then I suggest you discuss it with me or Aeltoth on the Wolven Workshop discord server (Link: https://discord.gg/NdZEAdgx)
